# TestBMI_PA2579

This project demonstrates property-based and automated testing using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).  
**No special Python version is required** (works with Python 3.8 and above, including 3.12+).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set up WSL or GitHub Actions workflows

- [How to set up GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/quickstart) (Recommended)
- [How to set up and install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

### 2. Clone or Download the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ethiomesi2020/TestBMI_PA2579.git
cd TestBMI_PA2579
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps dependencies isolated.

- **Linux/macOS:**
  ```sh
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows:**
  ```sh
  python -m venv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Code Style Checking

To check the code style automatically, run:

```sh
flake8 .
```
This will report any issues found according to PEP 8 and the `.flake8` configuration (if present).

---

## 🧪 Running All Tests

To run all tests (including those generated by Hypothesis):

```sh
- pytest
- python -m unittest test_WeightHelper.py
- pytest -v --hypothesis-show-statistics
```
- **pytest**, Will automatically discover and run all tests in files starting with `test_` (such as `test_WeightHelper.py`).
- **unittest**, It's called unit testing because it break down the functionality of the program into discrete testable behaviors that it can test as individual units.
- **Hypothesis**, Will automatically generate many different random test cases for the functions based on the strategies defined in the tests.
                 As it is based property tests, it help kill more mutants by generating many input cases automatically.

## 🧪 Mutation Testing (Efficacy Analysis)

To check how effective your tests are at catching bugs, you can run **mutation testing.**

### 1. Run mutation tests

```sh
python -m mutmut run
```

### 2. View results

```sh
mutmut results > mutmut_results.txt
mutmut show > mutmut_surviving_mutants.txt
```
- “Killed” mutants are bugs caught by the tests.
- “Survived” mutants are logic changes to the tests did NOT catch!

---

## 🤖 How Hypothesis Works (Automatic Test Generation)

- **Hypothesis** is a property-based testing library that generates a wide variety of test cases for this code.
- When we write test functions with the `@given(...)` decorator, which tells Hypothesis how to create input values.
- When we run `pytest`, Hypothesis automatically tries many combinations of those values, checking the assertions.

---

## 📈 Viewing Test Results

- After running `pytest`, you will see output indicating which tests passed or failed.
- If Hypothesis finds a failing example, it will show the minimal set of input values that cause the failure.
- We can use this output to debug and improve the code.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- If we have any issues with dependencies, ensure we are using a modern version of Python (3.8+).
- If we want to see more verbose output from pytest and Hypothesis, run:
  ```sh
  pytest -v
  ```
- If we get a `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed.
